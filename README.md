## Love Letter

To my dearest Joseph, It has been 4 days since we last saw each other and I cannot stop thinking about you. Your shining eyes will remain forever in my memory. The way you spoke so softly and held my hand made me feel so warm inside. I know our love is forbidden, but I don't care what anyone says. I will love you forever. I've left a note in your locker. Meet me in the hallway after class tomorrow. Yours truly, Sarah.

## Letter to the Editor
Dear Editor, I'm very disappointed about your recent article explaining that young people are going off the rails. This is not true at all. My friends and I are working hard at school and playing sport on the weekends. We are very busy people. We also have to deal with our parents. You can imagine, it's a difficult time. We would appreciate it if you didn't pubicly damage our reputation. Kind regards, Tony. 

## Job Application
To Whom It May Concern, I'm writing to apply for the front desk position you have advertised. I believe I would be a great candidate because I have excellent communication skills, good attention to detail and I am very reliable. I have experience working at a small office for my mother's accounting firm. Please find my CV attached. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions. Kind regards, Steve.
